# Specifying a Program

A program specification holds binary analysis facts for a given program or target function. A specification records facts from the Ghidra DB (ie. types etc).

## Specifying a Single Function

Generally, IRENE is used on a single function basis (ie. the function the user would like to patch). A single function specification can be generated by running the script `SpecifySingleFunction.java` which can be found by opening the Ghidra Script Manager and searching for the file. `SpecifySingleFunction` will generate a specification for the currently selected function in Ghidra and ask the user for a location to save the protobuf file.

A single function specification will consume slices specified via the [slice manager](slicing.md).

## Specifying a Whole Program

For whole program LLVM decompilation IRENE supports exporting a whole program specification (every function). This can be done through the GUI by `File -> Export Program -> Anvill protobuf spec`

`anvillHeadlessExportScript.java` can also be used to perform this functionality headlessly with `analyzeHeadless` in order to automate multiple runs from the command line.
